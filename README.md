# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns in a telecommunications dataset to identify key factors influencing customer retention and develop strategies to reduce churn rates.

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Customer Churn Dataset
- **Size**: 7,043 customer records
- **Features**: 21 columns including demographic information, service usage, contract details, and billing information

## Key Findings
1. **Overall Churn Rate**: 26.54% of customers have churned
2. **Key Factors Affecting Churn**:
   - Customer tenure (long-term customers are more loyal)
   - Contract type (month-to-month contracts have higher churn)
   - Service utilization (basic services show better retention)
   - Payment methods (electronic check correlates with higher churn)
   - Demographics (senior citizens show higher churn rates)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Analysis
4. Visualization of Key Patterns
5. Insights Generation

## Recommendations
1. Convert month-to-month contracts to longer-term agreements
2. Enhance value proposition of additional services
3. Review electronic check payment process
